# The candy machine

The candy machine is a program that allows you to mint NFTs with a fixed supply. It has a few different modes, but the one we're interested in is "start" mode. This allows you to set the supply of the NFTs you want to create, and the price per NFT. The candy machine program will then create the NFTs and put them up for sale on the Solana blockchain.

## What you'll need

-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#use-solanas-install-tool)
-   [Phantom wallet](https://phantom.app/)
-   [Metaplex CLI](https://...) (optional)

## Getting started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone
cd solana-candy-machine
npm install
```

## Creating a candy machine

To create a candy machine, you'll need to run the following command:

```bash
npm run create_candy_machine
```

This will create a new candy machine program on the Solana blockchain. It will also create a new wallet for you, and save the private key in a file called `wallet.json`. You'll need this file later on, so make sure you don't delete it.

## Uploading your NFTs

To upload your NFTs, you'll need to run the following command:

```bash
npm run upload
```

## Minting your NFTs

To mint your NFTs, you'll need to run the following command:

```bash
npm run mint
```

This will mint all of the NFTs that you uploaded earlier. It will also create a new wallet for you, and save the private key in a file called `wallet.json`. You'll need this file later on, so make sure you don't delete it.

## Configuring the candy machine

To configure the candy machine, you'll need to run the following command:

```bash
npm run configure_candy_machine
```

This will configure the candy machine program that you created earlier. It will set the price per NFT, and the number of NFTs that you want to mint.

## Starting the candy machine

To start the candy machine, you'll need to run the following command:

```bash
npm run start_candy_machine
```

This will start the candy machine program that you created earlier. It will put all of the NFTs that you minted up for sale on the Solana blockchain.

## Buying an NFT

To buy an NFT, you'll need to run the following command:

```bash
npm run buy_candy
```

This will buy an NFT from the candy machine program that you created earlier. It will use the wallet that you created earlier, and save the private key in a file called `wallet.json`. You'll need this file later on, so make sure you don't delete it.

## Stopping the candy machine

To stop the candy machine, you'll need to run the following command:

```bash
npm run stop_candy_machine
```

This will stop the candy machine program that you created earlier. It will stop all of the NFTs that you minted from being sold on the Solana blockchain.

## Destroying the candy machine

To destroy the candy machine, you'll need to run the following command:

```bash
npm run destroy_candy_machine
```

This will destroy the candy machine program that you created earlier. It will also destroy all of the NFTs that you minted.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with any of the commands, try running them with the `--help` flag. For example:

```bash
npm run create_candy_machine -- --help
```

This will show you all of the options that you can pass to the command.
